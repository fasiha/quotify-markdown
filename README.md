# Quote-ify Text for Markdown

You know how, in Markdown, you can prefix paragraphs with > to render them as quotations? Well. Here you go. [No ChatGPT needed](https://octodon.social/@22/110106740464871943).

Go to https://fasiha.github.io/quotify-markdown/. Paste some text into the big box, then click the big button. Your text, now quoted, will be copied to your clipboard, ready to paste into wherever you need Markdown.
